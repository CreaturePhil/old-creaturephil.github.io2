      The cinematography in the film Fight Club directed by David Fincher envelops the audience into its world and help contributes to the morals of the film’s story. Fight Club is about a guy trying to find meaning in life because of his frustrations of being someone in the American working class and not being able to pursue his dreams. The narrator is unreliable as we don’t know what's real or not since Tyler Durden is himself and for most of the film, the audience, and the narrator himself thought he was a real person. The narrator and Tyler Durden creates a club which has rules and where they fight to let out all their anger and frustration towards the world. Fincher used of the film format Super 35 allow for brilliant and amazing Cinematography in Fight Club. The cinematography in Fight Club contributes to the theme of dissatisfaction of class and society by cool and frigid tonality, depth of shots, and low key and available lighting.

      The opening scene’s cinematography in Fight Club help supply the theme of dissatisfaction of class and society by its cool colors and dark tonality. The opening scene starts off within the narrator’s brain and then explodes out of his pores into where the narrator is tied to a chair at gunpoint. The cool colors of the scene with shades of blue everywhere showcases how the inside of narrator’s brain is the same tone as the outside world. The shades of blues tonalities create a mood of sadness and despair. Furthermore, the low key and atmospheric lightning also play a role in engulfing the audience into the world and create a realistic feeling within the audience. By being entrapped in the world, the audience can relate to similar experiences of dissatisfaction of the world with the narrator. The next scenes after the opening are of the narrator at work with dull colors and lightning. The aesthetics of the opening sequence display how the narrator is unhappy with his current situation. The parallel of being at gunpoint and him living his life as an average worker never being able to fulfill his dream whatever that may be. The narrator is stuck in his societal class and wants out and Fight Club’s cinematography help conveys the theme of being dissatisfied with class and society.

      Fincher uses variations of close ups, medium and long shots to emphasize details and the environment. Fincher used of the motion picture film format Super 35 allow for sizable range and resilience in making those shots (Probst). The start of fight club and the first fight in the back of Lou’s Tavern Bar showcase with long and extreme long shots. According to Bordwell and Thompson’s Film Art An Introduction, “Long shots can permit us to explore vistas . . . [and] encourages us to explore details or discover abstract patterns” (Bordwell 197-198). This means that the pleasing view immerses the audience into the character’s world and allow for relations to happen. Relations such as empathizing with the characters as the audience[and] are grounded in the world. The shot is stationary as the narrator and Tyler Durden fight as well as the atmospheric lightning from the night and lights aid in the immersion. The long shot of the two fighting contributes to their dissatisfaction of the world and society by how it emphasizes the feeling of awareness, excitement, and pain in a society where individuals are dazed and callous.

      The consumerist culture in society imposes a dullness to individual’s lives and a loss of self which the film’s cinematography portrays through the usage of eye-level angle and available lightning. Lizardo, a professor of sociology, states that, “it strikes the heart of the consumerist ethic by deflating the ideology of self-expression and self-fulfillment - through the narcissism of consumption (such as that sustained when Jack wonders about the ‘kind of dining room set’ that defines him as a person)” (Lizardo 238-239). This means consuming goods like most people in society you are losing a sense of yourself. Through the usage of eye-level angle, the audience are able to empathize and relate to the narrator on screen who is just like them affected by consumerist culture. Furthermore, the broad handling of available lighting throughout helps create a realistic feeling adds the extra layer of immersing the audience in and more easily allows the audience to relate to the characters in the film. In the beginning scenes of the film, we see flashes of Tyler Durden on the screen such as one in office, hospital, and alleyway. It is quite quick and hard to catch at first but the audience can notice it is Tyler due to his red jacket which red, a warm color, catches the audience’s eye. Tyler flashing on the screen is done by superimposition. Bordwell states that “by double exposure either in the camera or in laboratory printing, one image is laid over another . . . [and] frequently provide a way of conveying dreams, vision, or memories” (Bordwell 179-180). The narrator mentally visions Tyler Durden as another person but it is himself. The film usage of superimposition shows that as the narrator becomes more dissatisfied with his class and society, he slowly envisions himself as being someone else. The cinematography in Fight Club helps the audience visualize what is going through the narrator’s head and create a reaction of relatedness and empathy with the narrator.

      Fight Club is a brilliant and intense film that acknowledges the writing in the movement to convey interesting and provoking ideas. Its themes and thoughts that the film dispatches are still relevant today. For example, the scene where the camera pans around the narrator’s apartment as it is an IKEA catalog. The film aggravates audiences to think about what surrounds them and what they truly want in life.
