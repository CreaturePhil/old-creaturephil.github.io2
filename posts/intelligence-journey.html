      Stanley Kubrick created an epic science-fiction film in 1968 called 2001: A Space Odyssey which is still greatly relatable to our world today. The film is about how an alien uses a black monolith to transmit information to apes and humans on Earth. The information is used to help them evolve with tools like weapons used for hunting and artificial intelligence like the HAL 9000. The film 2001: A Space Odyssey keeps many of the iconographic and musical elements of the science fiction genre but breaks away from some narrative and stylistic conventions through symbolism emphasizing Kubrick's message of how humanity can evolve.

      Copious amount of science fiction conventions are used in 2001: A Space Odyssey through music and iconography such as the setting of outer space, space traveling through wormholes, aliens, and paranormal abilities. After the beginning scenes of prehistoric times, many scenes showcase the futuristic setting of outer space 2001: A Space Odyssey is located in. The advance technology shown are the various types of spaceships and artificial intelligence like the HAL 9000. The HAL 9000 has such futuristic abilities such as machine vision, multiple voices recognition, and has the ability to mimic human brain which was presented in the scene where the men on the spaceship were eating and watching the interview about the HAL 9000. Space traveling through wormholes occur when the ship was near Jupiter and it was display through psychedelic lights and filtered landscapes. Although the aliens original form was never shown, it is alluded that the monoliths, the giant black slabs, shown throughout the film were sent by the aliens to help humankind evolve. The monoliths have paranormal abilities to give knowledge such as when they gave the information to the apes on how to make tools and when on the moon, gave the humans the knowledge on how to make general artificial intelligence. The stylistic convention of using a close up shot of futuristic technology is used to signify the importance of it to the plot. This is portrayed by the glowing red eye of the HAL 9000. 2001: A Space Odyssey’s music sticks to the science fiction genre conventions. Examples are of the musical composer Ligeti dissonant music when encountering the monoliths and Johann Strauss II's 1866 Blue Danube Waltz during a trip to the moon from the space station. Timothy Scheurer, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Shawnee State University, states that “Kubrick used his musical resources in a very conventional sense by having the music articulate the emotional core of the film” (Scheurer). The music used to emphasize the meaning of how technology influences humans.

      The film breaks away from conventions of the science fiction genre prominently through symbolism. According to Bordwell and Thompson’s Film Art An Introduction, “2001: A Space Odyssey violated several conventions of the science fiction genre: beginning with a lengthy sequence set in prehistoric times, synchronizing classical music to outer-space action, and ending with an enigmatically symbolic fetus drifting through space” (Bordwell 331). The prehistoric times setting is uncommon in the science fiction genre as usually the genre is set in outer space, post-apocalyptic world, or alternate timelines. The purpose of the sequence was to show how humans have evolved. The match cut from the bone being thrown by the ape to a spaceship in outer space was to relate the idea of how both of these things are tools. The apes evolve into humans but they both still relied on tools. Whether or not this reliance on technology is good or bad is up to the audience’s interpretation. Kubrick uses this reliance to show how humanity can transcend it by going into the next stage of evolution, the star baby. This is supported by the fetus drifting through space showcase at the end of the film. In addition, the nondiegetic classical music helps set the mood when the outer-space action is taking place.

      The theme of 2001: A Space Odyssey follows science fiction conventions by it having an unexplained phenomena of the monoliths and self-knowledge about humanity. The film’s theme work within the genre it is being told in by its focus on the effect of technology on humans and how we humans use technology to help us evolve and how technology can improve our lives but can hurt us as well. Scheurer states, “we believe in the ability of science to help us progress, but that progress will not be good without the human element, which is manifested in either creativity, compassion, or skepticism about that very science which should be a boon to humankind” (Scheurer). This means that in bettering our lives we must have the personal and individual aspects for science and technology to be universally beneficial. Finally, the theme is portrayed through the film with its aggregate music and visual. Scheurer backs with, “Kubrick would have us feel, based on his combination of visuals and music, is a sense of restless optimism about the future and a belief in the efficacy of creativity in the evolution of humankind” (Scheuer). The odyssey or quest that the film takes on implores our creatively to look forward to seeking new worlds and innovations.

      2001: A Space Odyssey effective and concise usage of the science fiction genre conventions creates an enlighten experience. It breaks away from the convention to add another layer or dimension of depth to the film which leads to the audience to have much more interpretations about the film. Even though the film displays how technology is used to create chaos, destruction, and violence as it is part of living life, but the film still evokes an optimistic hope toward the future.
