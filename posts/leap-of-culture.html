      Media is everywhere. It comes in various forms and it affects many people's lives on a daily basis. Having a diverse amount of culturally different individuals represented in media has a serious and wide influence. Currently, there is an underrepresentation of minorities in mainstream media. According to a diversity report study on prime time cable news, “67 percent of the guests on these cable programs were men, while 84 percent were white” (Gender). Furthermore, in scripted cable shows, “male and black characters were overrepresented, while Latino characters were notably underrepresented” (Report 2). In other words, these shows have more populated races represented than other minorities. The significance of cultural diversity in media broadens varying perspectives and complements self identity among individuals.

      Cultural representation in media conveys frequent aspects on how individuals are portrayed. This difference brings upon a unity of media consumers. Mohamed Zayani, a professor at Georgetown University, state “[c]ultural diversity is particularly important as it provides alternative viewpoints, but it is also significant insofar as it brings to the fore a valuable irreducible core” (Zayani 53). Mohamed articulates that not only does cultural portrayal give different perspectives but shares a common foundation with all who are involved. The importance of media cultural diversity and representation signifies various ways in which people see other culture’s way of thinking and living. Moreover, Mohamed claims, “Fostering cultural diversity in and through the media can go a long way toward bringing a civic discourse which promotes tolerance, facilitates coexistence and enriches the human existence” (Zayani 48). This means the promotion of diverse cultures in media promote positive factors. These factors of virtuous behaviors enable an abundant amount of utility. Furthermore, Mohamed supporting his claim states, “It can contribute to the breaking down of cultural barriers, the initiation of cultural dialogue, the promotion of global reconciliation, the empowerment of marginalized groups, the strengthening of social cohesion, and the practice of good governance” (Zayani 48). Zayani point is that the fostering of cultural diversity commits to clear value of people involved. All these positives factors led up to how very important cultural diversity in media is and the importance of it is the advancing of societal relationships.

      Numerous individuals identify themselves in the media and representing their cultural, racial, and ethnic background is compelling to their self identity. Yahya R. Kamalipour, a professor and chair of the Department of Journalism and Mass Communication states, “We now live in a mass-mediated cultural environment in which the mass media play a crucial and often decisive role in the enhancement or destruction of images of other people, places, religions, and other nations of the world” (Kamalipour xix). The media dictates stereotypes, the status quo, and self identity of individuals. This affects how people see themselves and internal reflection of who they are. Yahya concludes that, “The media must take a stand, promoting cultural awareness and teaching people to recognize and embrace difference” (Kamalipour xx). This means the media has a responsibility of balancing the cultural representations which affects society. The significance of cultural diversity in communication by broadcast or publications is the influence of people’s self identity.

      Some individuals will regard cultural diversity and representation in media as insignificant. This is because of discrete reasons such as oblivious nature to diversity, superior feeling of being dominant over other cultures, or believer of free will over behavioral influences like B. F. Skinner's ideas. Resistance among employees, discrimination, and increase costs are barriers that cultural diversity faces. These barriers are high enough that overcoming them is not worth the benefits. Nobuko Kawashima, a faculty member at Doshisha University, quotes Cowen, “it is not diversity per se that is important, but creative innovation and mutual understandings promoted through exposure to different cultures that is more valuable to the humankind” (Kawashima 487). Cowen means that there is a blending of culture and that we do not need to diversify of different regions to gain the benefits. While a mixture of cultures is coming forth, having varying diversity now can benefit everyone sooner at minimal costs.

      The cultural diversity and representation in media is important to many lives as it increases people’s perspectives and help individuals with their self identity. Cultivating culture enriches the human experience. People should spread the word and advocate for more cultural diversity in not just media but also in other aspects of life.
